## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds and compares five machine learning classification algorithms to predict whether a bank customer will purchase health insurance based on their **Age** and **Estimated Salary**. The goal is to identify the most accurate and generalizable model for deployment in a real banking environment.

## 🎯 Business Goal

> As an Analyst at a Bank Insurance Company, leverage customer demographic data to build an AI model capable of predicting insurance purchase behaviour — enabling smarter, more targeted marketing campaigns.

## 📊 Dataset

| Property         | Details                              |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Records          | 400 customers                        |
| Features         | Age (18–65), Estimated Salary        |
| Target           | Purchased (1 = Yes, 0 = No)          |
| Train/Test Split | 75% / 25%                            |
| Scaling          | StandardScaler applied to all models |

**To use your own dataset**, replace the synthetic block in the script with:

```python
df = pd.read_csv('Social_Network_Ads.csv')
df = df[['Age', 'EstimatedSalary', 'Purchased']]
```

## ❓ Questions Answered

### Q1 — Predictions: Set 1

| Age | Salary      | Prediction     |
|-----|-------------|----------------|
| 30  | $87,000     | ✔ PURCHASE     |
| 40  | No Salary   | ✘ NO PURCHASE  |
| 40  | $100,000    | ✔ PURCHASE     |
| 50  | No Salary   | ✘ NO PURCHASE  |

### Q2 — Predictions: Set 2 (Extreme Values)

| Age | Salary          | Prediction     |
|-----|-----------------|----------------|
| 18  | No Salary       | ✘ NO PURCHASE  |
| 22  | $600,000        | ✔ PURCHASE     |
| 35  | $2,500,000      | ✔ PURCHASE     |
| 60  | $100,000,000    | ✔ PURCHASE     |

### Q3 — Hypotheses Testing

| Hypothesis                                          | Result              |
|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| H1: Young + high salary → more likely to buy        | ✅ Partially Supported |
| H2: Older + high salary → less likely to buy        | ❌ Not Supported     |
| H3: Salary has stronger impact than age             | ✅ Supported         |

### Q4 — Lessons Learned

- Feature scaling is **critical** for KNN and SVM
- No single best algorithm — choice depends on business priority (recall vs precision)
- Tree models do **not extrapolate** beyond training data range
- Missing/zero salary values **dominate** predictions regardless of age

---

## 🔑 Key Findings

- **Salary is the dominant predictor.** Customers with no income are predicted not to purchase regardless of age.
- **Middle-aged customers (35–50)** with moderate-to-high salaries are the core insurance-buying demographic.
- **KNN/SVM** are best when you want to maximise leads captured (high recall).
- **Random Forest** is best when lead quality matters more than quantity (high precision).
- **Decision Trees** are the weakest performer and most prone to overfitting.

## 🌍 Real-Life Applications

### Case Study 1 — Targeted Insurance Marketing
Use **Random Forest** (highest precision) to score the full customer base and identify the top 20% most likely purchasers — reducing campaign costs by up to 80% while maintaining revenue.

### Case Study 2 — Loan Default Risk Profiling
Apply the same pipeline with features like credit score, debt-to-income ratio, and employment history. Use **KNN/SVM** (high recall) to flag potential defaulters for review, reducing manual processing time by ~60%.
